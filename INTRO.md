This wiki serves as the API reference for the development version (1) of
`google-musicmanager.js`. To peruse the documentation for the stable releases,
checkout the tags on the `wiki` repository (2). They lack a nice web
interface, but the source files have been kept reasonably human-readable.
Refer to the changelog (3) to see how the documentation has evolved since each
stable release.

To avoid cluttering the page sources, this wiki uses a few conventions that
may appear distracting at first. Class and namespace members are separated
from their class/namespace by a hash sign (as in [Operation#start](Operation#start.md)), as this
lets the wiki autolink them as URL fragment identifiers. Global JavaScript
objects referenced by the documentation are referenced in a separate [window](window.md)
page (as in [window#XMLHttpRequest](window#XMLHttpRequest.md)), as constant links to external sites
would clutter the page sources with long URLs.
